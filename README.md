## Deep Reinforcement Learning in TensorFlow

- *survey*
- *walk through already implemented algorithms*
- *to implement below algorithms explicitly in tensorflow-keras(extension to gym and pytorch)*

    * Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
    * Double DQN
    * Dueling DQN
    * Async Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)
    * Async One-Step Q-Learning
    * Async One-Step Sarsa 
    * Async N-Step Q-Learning
    * Continuous A3C
    * Distributed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (Distributed DDPG, aka D3PG)
    * Hybrid Reward Architecture (HRA)
    * Parallelized Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O, similar to DPPO)
    * Action Conditional Video Prediction
